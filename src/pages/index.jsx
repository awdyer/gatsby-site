        <h1>Richard Hamming on Luck</h1>
        <p>
            From Richard Hamming’s classic and must-read talk, “
            <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">
                You and Your Research
            </a>
            ”.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn’t. The prepared mind sooner or
                later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck.{" "}
                <em>The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.</em>
            </p>
